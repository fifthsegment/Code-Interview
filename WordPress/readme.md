# Make this better.

This plugin was written very poorly, without using the WordPress standards.

## 1. Improve the code

- Make the plugin work (It should display content from a `funny-quote` custom post type in a widget)
- Improve the code _as much as you possibly can_
- Fix anything you think could be improvedâ€”backward compatibility is not a consideration
- Fix any security issues
- Add WordPress-style [PHP DocBlocks](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/)
- Make the plugin fully translatable
- Update the `readme.txt` file to be helpful for the users
- Use Git commit messages as if you're working with a team on this plugin

## 2. Add functionality

- Add a `[funny_quotes]` shortcode to output quotes
- Make sure the widget works in the WordPress Customizer
- Add a setting to show each quote for a set amount of time:
    - Every page load
    - 1 per hour
    - One per day

## 3. Answer a question:

Please update the `readme.txt` "Other Notes" section with your response to this question:

> How would you suggest integrating [Owl Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/) functionality so that quotes can dynamically be fetched and displayed in a carousel? Please address how the settings might be handled via the widget and shortcode.

Actual code is not needed, just your thoughts.
